# Masters of CyberSec 
  This is where i will be keeping a repository of scripts that i will be writing through the course. 







# Principles of Security Engineering- Hashing

 This script was designed to complete 2 main functions. 1) Encode MD5 and SHA1. 2) Brute-force MD5 and SHA1
 The Brute-force function runs off a wordlist of 10,000 words, these are the most popular words used for passwords.
 If the hash you have used is not Brute-forced then it would not be in the list. As this script was designed for
 educational purposes, a 10,000 word wordlist was deemed large enough, but can be easily swapped out with any text
 based wordlist.

 If you want to test it, try 'password', or anything else you want.
